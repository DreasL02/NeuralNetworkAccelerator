# Hardware Accelerator Generator for Neural Networks in Chisel

This repository documents a WIP Hardware Neural Network Accelerator Generator for FPGAs.\
It is written in Chisel 5.0.

The project is part of both a Special Course and a Bachelor project at the Technical University of Denmark (DTU).

The old, but longer read-me for the special course version of this project (late-2023) can be
